## 11 ORGANIC CHEMISTRY

**Preamble**

While organic chemistry has unique aspects, it's important to connect it with other syllabus topics.  Candidates are encouraged to group organic reactions by mechanism and compare/contrast them.  When describing preparations, specify reagents (e.g., aqueous NaOH), essential conditions (e.g., reflux), and major products.  Specific temperature/pressure values and detailed practical procedures aren't required. However, candidates might suggest purification/extraction steps based on reagents, conditions, and products.  In redox reactions, [O] and [H] are acceptable.
