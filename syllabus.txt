11 ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
Preamble
Although there are features of organic chemistry topics that are distinctive, it is intended that appropriate cross-
references with other sections/topics in the syllabus should be made.
In their study of organic chemistry, candidates may wish to group the organic reactions in terms of the
mechanisms in the syllabus where possible. Candidates may wish to compare and contrast the different
mechanisms.
When describing preparative reactions, candidates will be expected to quote the reagents, e.g. aqueous NaOH,
the essential practical conditions, e.g. reflux, high temperature and pressure, and the identity of each of the
major products. Detailed conditions involving specific temperature and pressure values are not required.
Detailed knowledge of practical procedures is also not required: however, candidates may be expected to
suggest (from their knowledge of the reagents, essential conditions and products) what steps may be needed to
purify/extract a required product from the reaction mixture. In equations for organic redox reactions, the symbols
[O] and [H] are acceptable.
11.1 INTRODUCTION
Content
• Empirical, molecular and structural formulae
• Functional groups and the naming of organic compounds
• Shapes of organic molecules; σ and π bonds
Candidates are expected to be able to interpret and use the following types of representations in the description
of organic molecules. The examples given are for the compound (+)-lactic acid.
Empirical Formula: simplest ratio of the number of atoms of the elements present in one molecule, e.g. CH2O
Molecular Formula: actual number of the atoms of the elements present in one molecule, e.g. C3H6O3
Structural Formula: shows how the constituent atoms of a molecule are joined together with minimal detail,
using conventional groups, for an unambiguous structure, e.g. CH3CH(OH)CO2H
Full Structural or Displayed Formula: detailed structure of molecule showing the relative placing of atoms and
the number of bonds between them,
e.g.
Where a benzene ring is part of the molecule, a displayed formula for benzene will not be expected to be drawn.

Skeletal Formula: simplified representation of an organic formula derived from the structural formula by
removing hydrogen atoms (and their associated bonds) and carbon atoms from alkyl chains, leaving just the
carbon-carbon bonds in the carbon skeleton and the associated functional groups.
Skeletal or partial skeletal representations may be used in question papers and are acceptable in candidates’
answers where they are unambiguous,
e.g.
The convention for representing the aromatic ring is preferred.
Stereochemical Formula: show spatial arrangement of bonds, atoms and groups in molecule in 3-D,
e.g.
O
OH

the convention used in the example below.
